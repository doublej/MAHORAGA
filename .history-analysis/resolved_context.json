    "original": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Context from previous session**: User had installed linters (ESLint, Prettier), migrated from npm to bun, deployed, and identified LLM parse errors (49 \"Unexpected end of JSON input\" errors with empty contentPreview).\n\n2. **User: \"Determine the root cause of the llm issue, fix that. Find proper names\"**\n   - I read `src/providers/llm/openai.ts` and `src/providers/types.ts`\n   - Identified two issues: empty content validation and model prefix matching\n   - Found `REASONING_PREFIXES` and `RESPONSES_PREFIXES` arrays\n   - Searched for current OpenAI model names (found GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1, GPT-5, o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1 series)\n   - Read factory.ts and anthropic.ts to understand provider selection\n   - Fixed three things:\n     1. `openai.ts`: Changed prefix matching to handle dot versions via `matchesPrefix()` function\n     2. `openai.ts`: Added empty content validation in `completeWithChatCompletions` (line 226)\n     3. `openai.ts`: Added empty content validation in `extractResponsesText` (line 98)\n     4. `anthropic.ts`: Added empty text check in `extractContent` (line 88)\n   - Removed `gpt-5.1-codex` from RESPONSES_PREFIXES (now covered by `gpt-5` with dot matching)\n\n3. **User: \"deploy\"**\n   - Deployed successfully, version `faba361b-bfb3-4c9a-895b-22ef1cef32c9`\n\n4. **User: \"fetch endpoints check for errors\"**\n   - Token from .env didn't match deployed secret\n   - Used MCP tools instead - all endpoints returning OK\n   - Account active, 1 BTCUSD position, no orders, no errors visible via MCP\n\n5. **User: \"get logs\"**\n   - Tried wrangler tail, wrangler secret get\n   - Found logs endpoint is at `/agent/logs` in the harness\n   - MCP tools don't expose logs endpoint directly\n   - Auth issue: .env token doesn't match deployed MAHORAGA_API_TOKEN secret\n\n6. **User: \"theres a log api endpoint right\"**\n   - Confirmed `/agent/logs` exists at line 724 in harness\n   - MCP auth-verify works (authenticates against Alpaca, not the worker)\n\n7. **User pasted large logs JSON** showing parse errors still happening\n   - Logs showed transition at 21:11: old `parse_error` with empty contentPreview \u2192 new `research_error` with \"MahoragaError: OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\"\n   - This confirmed the validation fix was deployed and working\n   - But the underlying issue remained: OpenAI returning empty content 100%\n\n8. **User: \"Provider is set via LLM_PROVIDER env var... Research Model: gpt-5-mini, Analyst Model: gpt-5\"**\n   - This was from the dashboard settings, showing the RUNNING config uses gpt-5-mini and gpt-5\n   - Not the default `claude-haiku-4-20250414` from code\n\n9. **I investigated the Responses API**:\n   - Checked `wrangler secret list` - found NO `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` deployed, only `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n   - Consulted OpenAI docs via Context7\n   - **Found the actual root cause**: `extractResponsesText` checked for `content.type === 'output_text'` but the OpenAI Responses API returns `content.type === 'text'`\n   - Also discovered the response has `output_text` convenience field we weren't using\n\n10. **Fix applied**:\n    - Added `output_text?: string` to `OpenAIResponsesResponse` interface\n    - Rewrote `extractResponsesText` to:\n      1. Use `data.output_text` first (top-level convenience field)\n      2. Fall back to parsing `output[].content[]` with correct type check (`\"text\"` not `\"output_text\"`)\n    - Deployed as version `285374a8-c896-429a-b000-9d5a70ecb6d5`\n\n11. **User pasted latest logs** - still showing \"OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\" errors post-deploy\n    - The latest deploy (with output_text fix) timestamps from the log: all errors still showing after 21:26\n    - This means the `output_text` fix also didn't work, or the Durable Object hasn't picked up the new version yet, or there's yet another issue\n\nThe logs show the newest deploy should have been picked up after 21:32 (version 285374a8). But errors continue. The `output_text` field might not be present in the response, or the response itself may have empty output due to something else entirely.\n\nWait - looking at the timestamps more carefully:\n- Deploy happened around 21:10 (first deploy with validation)  \n- Second deploy (output_text fix) happened... let me check. The user said \"deploy\" and I deployed, then they said \"fetch endpoints\" then \"get logs\" then posted logs. The second deploy with the `extractResponsesText` fix was done during the last exchange before the user pasted these latest logs.\n\nActually the latest version `285374a8` was deployed just before the user pasted these logs. The Durable Object may take time to pick up the new version, or there could be caching. But many of the latest errors at 21:33-21:36 are STILL showing \"OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\" which means either:\n1. The DO hasn't restarted with the new code yet\n2. OR the fix isn't working because `output_text` is also empty/missing\n\nThis needs further investigation. The response from OpenAI might genuinely have no content - perhaps the API key has issues, or the model+request combination is problematic.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Determine the root cause of LLM empty response errors (100% failure rate on all LLM calls)\n   - Fix the issue and deploy\n   - Find proper/valid model names for OpenAI models\n   - Monitor production logs to verify fixes\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - OpenAI Responses API vs Chat Completions API (different endpoints, different response formats)\n   - OpenAI Responses API returns `output_text` top-level field and `output[].content[].type === \"text\"` (NOT `\"output_text\"`)\n   - Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects (persistent state, may not immediately pick up new deploys)\n   - LLM provider factory pattern (auto-selects Claude or OpenAI based on available API keys)\n   - Model prefix matching for routing to correct API endpoint\n   - Current valid OpenAI models: GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1, GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1 series\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **src/providers/llm/openai.ts** (THE critical file - all bugs are here)\n     - **Fix 1**: Prefix matching now handles dot versions (gpt-5.1, gpt-5.2)\n     - **Fix 2**: Empty content validation in both API paths\n     - **Fix 3**: `extractResponsesText` rewritten to use `output_text` and correct type check\n     ```typescript\n     const REASONING_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5'];\n     const RESPONSES_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5', 'gpt-4.1', 'gpt-4o'];\n\n     function matchesPrefix(model: string, prefixes: string[]): boolean {\n       return prefixes.some(p => model === p || model.startsWith(`${p}-`) || model.startsWith(`${p}.`));\n     }\n\n     function isReasoningModel(model: string): boolean {\n       return matchesPrefix(model, REASONING_PREFIXES);\n     }\n\n     function shouldUseResponses(model: string): boolean {\n       return matchesPrefix(model, RESPONSES_PREFIXES);\n     }\n     ```\n     - Response interface now includes `output_text`:\n     ```typescript\n     interface OpenAIResponsesResponse {\n       id: string;\n       output?: OpenAIResponsesOutputItem[];\n       output_text?: string;\n       usage?: {\n         input_tokens?: number;\n         output_tokens?: number;\n         total_tokens?: number;\n       };\n     }\n     ```\n     - Rewritten extraction function:\n     ```typescript\n     function extractResponsesText(data: OpenAIResponsesResponse): string {\n       if (data.output_text) return data.output_text;\n\n       for (const item of data.output ?? []) {\n         if (item.type === 'message' && Array.isArray(item.content)) {\n           for (const block of item.content) {\n             if (block.type === 'text' && block.text) return block.text;\n           }\n         }\n       }\n\n       throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, 'OpenAI Responses API returned empty content');\n     }\n     ```\n     - Chat Completions empty content validation:\n     ```typescript\n     const content = data.choices[0]?.message?.content;\n     if (!content) {\n       throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, 'OpenAI Chat Completions returned empty content');\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **src/providers/llm/anthropic.ts** (minor fix)\n     - Empty text block validation:\n     ```typescript\n     for (const block of response.content) {\n       if (block.type === 'text' && block.text) return block.text;\n     }\n     throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, 'Claude returned empty or missing content');\n     ```\n\n   - **src/providers/llm/factory.ts** (read-only, for understanding)\n     - Auto mode: prefers Claude if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists, falls back to OpenAI\n     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is NOT deployed \u2192 OpenAI provider is active\n\n   - **src/durable-objects/mahoraga-harness.ts** (read-only, for understanding)\n     - Default config: `llm_model: 'claude-haiku-4-20250414'` (but running config overridden to `gpt-5-mini` via dashboard)\n     - `complete()` calls do NOT pass `model` param \u2192 uses provider's constructor default\n     - Logs endpoint at `/agent/logs` (line 724)\n     - Log buffer keeps last 500 entries\n\n   - **Deployed secrets** (from `wrangler secret list`):\n     - ALPACA_API_KEY, ALPACA_API_SECRET, ALPACA_PAPER\n     - KILL_SWITCH_SECRET, MAHORAGA_API_TOKEN\n     - OPENAI_API_KEY, TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN\n     - **NO ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** \u2192 OpenAI provider is used\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **Error: `extractResponsesText` checked `content.type === 'output_text'` but API returns `type === 'text'`**\n     - This was THE root cause of 100% LLM failure\n     - Fix: Rewrote to use `data.output_text` first, then fall back to checking `type === 'text'`\n   - **Error: Empty content from providers silently passed through**\n     - Both OpenAI paths returned `''` instead of throwing\n     - Fix: Added explicit throws with `PROVIDER_ERROR` in both paths\n   - **Error: Model prefix matching missed dot versions**\n     - `gpt-5.1` didn't match `gpt-5` prefix (only checked dash separator)\n     - Fix: Added `model.startsWith(p + '.')` to `matchesPrefix()`\n   - **Error: .env MAHORAGA_API_TOKEN doesn't match deployed secret**\n     - Used MCP tools (which auth via Alpaca) as workaround\n     - Not yet resolved\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Traced the error from logs \u2192 parse_error with empty contentPreview \u2192 providers returning empty strings \u2192 `extractResponsesText` wrong type check\n   - Three progressive deploys:\n     1. Version `faba361b`: Added empty content validation (errors changed from `parse_error` to `research_error`)\n     2. Version `285374a8`: Fixed `extractResponsesText` to use correct response format\n   - **STILL FAILING**: Latest logs (21:26-21:36) still show \"OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\" even after the `output_text` fix deploy. The Durable Object may not have restarted yet, OR the OpenAI API is genuinely returning empty responses (API key issues, model issues, or request format issues).\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"Determine the root cause of the llm issue, fix that. Find proper names\"\n   - \"deploy\"\n   - \"fetch endpoints check for errors\"\n   - \"get logs\"\n   - \"theres a log api endpoint right\"\n   - [Pasted large logs JSON showing parse_error \u2192 research_error transition]\n   - \"Provider is set via LLM_PROVIDER env var (auto/openai/claude). Models must match your active provider. Research Model (cheap): gpt-5-mini, Analyst Model (smart): gpt-5\" [from dashboard settings]\n   - [Pasted latest logs JSON still showing errors after second deploy]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - LLM calls still failing 100% in production \u2014 need to determine if the latest deploy's `output_text` fix resolved it (DO may need restart) or if the OpenAI API itself is returning empty responses\n   - If OpenAI genuinely returns empty content, need to investigate: API key validity, request format, model availability\n   - .env MAHORAGA_API_TOKEN doesn't match deployed secret (can't hit /agent/logs directly from CLI)\n   - Git commit of all changes not yet done\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The user pasted the latest logs showing errors STILL occurring after the `output_text` fix deploy (version `285374a8`). All entries after 21:26 still show `\"MahoragaError: OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\"`. This means either:\n   1. The Durable Object hasn't picked up the new code version yet\n   2. OR `output_text` is also empty/missing in the actual OpenAI response, meaning the API genuinely returns no content\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Need to add debug logging to the `completeWithResponses` method to capture the raw API response from OpenAI \u2014 specifically log `response.status`, `data.output_text`, `data.output?.length`, and `JSON.stringify(data).substring(0, 500)` to understand what OpenAI is actually returning. This will determine if the API returns empty content or if our parsing is still wrong. Alternatively, test the API key directly with a curl command to verify it works.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/projects/-Users-jurrejan-Documents-development-web-MAHORAGA/cbd96987-1eb1-4443-9ca3-36ac98a111da.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

Problem Solving:\n   - Traced the error from logs \u2192 parse_error with empty contentPreview \u2192 providers returning empty strings \u2192 `extractResponsesText` wrong type check\n   - Three progressive deploys:\n     1. Version `faba361b`: Added empty content validation (errors changed from `parse_error` to `research_error`)\n     2. Version `285374a8`: Fixed `extractResponsesText` to use correct response format\n   - **STILL FAILING**: Latest logs (21:26-21:36) still show \"OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\" even after the `output_text` fix deploy. The Durable Object may not have restarted yet, OR the OpenAI API is genuinely returning empty responses (API key issues, model issues, or request format issues).\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"Determine the root cause of the llm issue, fix that. Find proper names\"\n   - \"deploy\"\n   - \"fetch endpoints check for errors\"\n   - \"get logs\"\n   - \"theres a log api endpoint right\"\n   - [Pasted large logs JSON showing parse_error \u2192 research_error transition]\n   - \"Provider is set via LLM_PROVIDER env var (auto/openai/claude). Models must match your active provider. Research Model (cheap): gpt-5-mini, Analyst Model (smart): gpt-5\" [from dashboard settings]\n   - [Pasted latest logs JSON still showing errors after second deploy]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - LLM calls still failing 100% in production \u2014 need to determine if the latest deploy's `output_text` fix resolved it (DO may need restart) or if the OpenAI API itself is returning empty responses\n   - If OpenAI genuinely returns empty content, need to investigate: API key validity, request format, model availability\n   - .env MAHORAGA_API_TOKEN doesn't match deployed secret (can't hit /agent/logs directly from CLI)\n   - Git commit of all changes not yet done\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The user pasted the latest logs showing errors STILL occurring after the `output_text` fix deploy (version `285374a8`). All entries after 21:26 still show `\"MahoragaError: OpenAI Responses API returned empty content\"`. This means either:\n   1. The Durable Object hasn't picked up the new code version yet\n   2. OR `output_text` is also empty/missing in the actual OpenAI response, meaning the API genuinely returns no content\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Need to add debug logging to the `completeWithResponses` method to capture the raw API response from OpenAI \u2014 specifically log `response.status`, `data.output_text`, `data.output?.length`, and `JSON.stringify(data).substring(0, 500)` to understand what OpenAI is actually returning. This will determine if the API returns empty content or if our parsing is still wrong. Alternatively, test the API key directly with a curl command to verify it works.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/projects/-Users-jurrejan-Documents-development-web-MAHORAGA/cbd96987-1eb1-4443-9ca3-36ac98a111da.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

    "original": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Context from previous session**: The user had been dealing with LLM parse errors (49 \"Unexpected end of JSON input\" errors with empty contentPreview). The previous session identified that OpenAI Responses API was returning empty content.\n\n2. **User: \"continue\"** - Continue from where the previous session left off investigating LLM issues.\n\n3. **I added debug logging** to `openai.ts` to capture what OpenAI was actually returning:\n   - Model, status, output_text, output items, raw keys, first output item\n   - Deployed and captured logs via wrangler tail\n\n4. **Debug logs revealed**:\n   - `status: \"incomplete\"` - Model didn't finish\n   - `output_text: undefined` - No output_text field\n   - `firstOutput: {\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[]}` - Only reasoning output, no message\n   - Also saw 403 `unsupported_country_region_territory` errors\n\n5. **Root cause identified**: `gpt-5-mini` was being treated as a reasoning model (matched `gpt-5` prefix in `REASONING_PREFIXES`), but it's NOT a reasoning model. This caused:\n   - Response status \"incomplete\" \n   - Only reasoning output items, no message items\n   \n6. **Fix 1 - Reasoning model classification**:\n   - Changed `REASONING_PREFIXES` from `['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5']` to `['o1', 'o3', 'o4']`\n   - Added `REASONING_EXACT = ['gpt-5']` for exact match only\n   - Updated `isReasoningModel()` to check both\n\n7. **Error: temperature not supported** - After deploying, got error that temperature is not supported with gpt-5-mini on Responses API.\n   - Added `NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5']`\n   - Added `supportsTemperature()` function\n   - Updated both Responses API and Chat Completions paths\n\n8. **User: \"We already fixed this by moving the thing to US\"** - They had already added location hint for the Durable Object.\n\n9. **Error: Geo-restriction persisted initially**, then after testing:\n   - Error changed to `max_tokens` not supported - need `max_completion_tokens`\n   - Fixed by using `max_completion_tokens` for gpt-5 family\n\n10. **More errors**:\n    - Routed `-mini` models to Chat Completions API (broader geo support)\n    - Fixed temperature for Chat Completions (gpt-5 family doesn't support custom temp)\n\n11. **LLM finally working** - `symbol-research AAPL` returned a full research report\n\n12. **User: \"urk?\"** - I tested TSLA, also worked\n\n13. **User: \"URL?\"** - Provided https://mahoraga.jurrejan.workers.dev\n\n14. **User: \"It says reasearching candidates but it seems not much is happening\"** - Dashboard shows \"Researching candidates...\" but no data\n\n15. **Investigation**:\n    - `signalResearch` was empty (that's why dashboard shows the message)\n    - `prices-bars` returned 0 bars\n    - `technicals-get` failed with \"Insufficient data\"\n    - Root cause: Alpaca bars API requires a `start` date, but none was provided\n\n16. **Fix - Default start date for bars**:\n    - Added default start date to `getBars()` in `market-data.ts`\n    - 1 year ago for daily, 7 days for intraday\n    - Deployed and tested - bars now return data\n\n17. **User: \"deployed?\"** - Confirmed yes, version `49d5fe03`\n\nKey files modified:\n- `src/providers/llm/openai.ts` - Multiple fixes for model classification, temperature, max_tokens\n- `src/providers/llm/anthropic.ts` - Empty content validation\n- `src/providers/alpaca/market-data.ts` - Default start date for bars\n\nCommits:\n- `e13993f` - fix: correct OpenAI Responses API parsing and model classification\n- `19cec67` - fix: remove temperature for gpt-5 family on Chat Completions\n- `ee6ee01` - fix: add default start date for Alpaca bars API\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Fix LLM issues causing 100% failure rate on all OpenAI API calls\n   - Diagnose why dashboard shows \"Researching candidates...\" with no data appearing\n   - Deploy fixes and verify they work in production\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - OpenAI Responses API vs Chat Completions API (different endpoints, response formats, parameter support)\n   - OpenAI model classification: reasoning models (o1, o3, o4, gpt-5) vs non-reasoning (gpt-5-mini, gpt-4o)\n   - Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects with location hints (`locationHint: 'wnam'`)\n   - Alpaca Market Data API - requires `start` date parameter for historical bars\n   - gpt-5 family API quirks: no custom temperature (only default 1), uses `max_completion_tokens` not `max_tokens`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`src/providers/llm/openai.ts`** (Critical - all LLM fixes)\n     - Fixed model classification, temperature handling, response parsing\n     ```typescript\n     // Reasoning models get special treatment (no temperature, reasoning effort param)\n     // Note: -mini variants are NOT reasoning models even if they use the Responses API\n     const REASONING_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4'];\n     // gpt-5 reasoning: only the full model, not mini\n     const REASONING_EXACT = ['gpt-5'];\n\n     // Models that use the Responses API (instead of Chat Completions)\n     const RESPONSES_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5', 'gpt-4.1', 'gpt-4o'];\n\n     // Models that don't support temperature on the Responses API\n     const NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5'];\n\n     function matchesPrefix(model: string, prefixes: string[]): boolean {\n       return prefixes.some(p => model === p || model.startsWith(`${p}-`) || model.startsWith(`${p}.`));\n     }\n\n     function isReasoningModel(model: string): boolean {\n       // o1, o3, o4 prefixes are always reasoning\n       if (matchesPrefix(model, REASONING_PREFIXES)) return true;\n       // gpt-5 exact match only (not gpt-5-mini, gpt-5.1, etc.)\n       return REASONING_EXACT.includes(model);\n     }\n\n     function shouldUseResponses(model: string): boolean {\n       // Exclude -mini variants from Responses API (use Chat Completions for broader geo support)\n       if (model.endsWith('-mini')) return false;\n       return matchesPrefix(model, RESPONSES_PREFIXES);\n     }\n\n     function supportsTemperature(model: string): boolean {\n       return !matchesPrefix(model, NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES);\n     }\n     ```\n     - Response status validation:\n     ```typescript\n     function extractResponsesText(data: OpenAIResponsesResponse): string {\n       // Check response status - only \"completed\" has valid output\n       if (data.status && data.status !== 'completed') {\n         const errMsg = data.error?.message || `response status: ${data.status}`;\n         throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, `OpenAI Responses API: ${errMsg}`);\n       }\n\n       if (data.output_text) return data.output_text;\n\n       for (const item of data.output ?? []) {\n         if (item.type === 'message' && Array.isArray(item.content)) {\n           for (const block of item.content) {\n             if (block.type === 'text' && block.text) return block.text;\n           }\n         }\n       }\n\n       throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, 'OpenAI Responses API returned empty content');\n     }\n     ```\n     - Chat Completions max_completion_tokens fix:\n     ```typescript\n     // gpt-5 family uses max_completion_tokens, older models use max_tokens\n     const usesMaxCompletionTokens = reasoning || model.startsWith('gpt-5');\n     if (usesMaxCompletionTokens) {\n       body.max_completion_tokens = params.max_tokens ?? 1024;\n     } else {\n       body.max_tokens = params.max_tokens ?? 1024;\n     }\n\n     // gpt-5 family doesn't support custom temperature (only default 1)\n     if (!reasoning && supportsTemperature(model)) {\n       body.temperature = params.temperature ?? 0.7;\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/providers/alpaca/market-data.ts`** (Fixed empty bars issue)\n     - Added default start date for bars API:\n     ```typescript\n     async getBars(symbol: string, timeframe: string, params?: BarsParams): Promise<Bar[]> {\n       // Default start: 1 year ago for daily, 7 days for intraday\n       const defaultStart = new Date();\n       if (timeframe === '1Day') {\n         defaultStart.setFullYear(defaultStart.getFullYear() - 1);\n       } else {\n         defaultStart.setDate(defaultStart.getDate() - 7);\n       }\n\n       const response = await this.client.dataRequest<AlpacaBarsResponse | { bars: AlpacaBar[] }>(\n         'GET',\n         `/v2/stocks/${encodeURIComponent(symbol)}/bars`,\n         {\n           timeframe,\n           start: params?.start ?? defaultStart.toISOString(),\n           end: params?.end,\n           limit: params?.limit,\n           adjustment: params?.adjustment,\n           feed: params?.feed,\n         }\n       );\n       // ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/providers/llm/anthropic.ts`** (Minor fix)\n     - Added empty text block validation\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **`status: \"incomplete\"` with only reasoning output**: gpt-5-mini was misclassified as reasoning model\n     - Fixed by separating `REASONING_PREFIXES` and `REASONING_EXACT`, excluding mini variants\n   - **`temperature not supported with this model`**: Responses API for gpt-5 family doesn't support temperature\n     - Added `NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES` and `supportsTemperature()` function\n   - **`403 unsupported_country_region_territory`**: Geo-restriction on OpenAI API\n     - User had already fixed with `locationHint: 'wnam'` in DO stub\n     - Also routed `-mini` models to Chat Completions for broader geo support\n   - **`max_tokens not supported, use max_completion_tokens`**: gpt-5 family API difference\n     - Added check for gpt-5 prefix to use `max_completion_tokens`\n   - **`temperature 0.5 not supported, only default (1)`**: gpt-5-mini on Chat Completions\n     - Extended temperature exclusion to Chat Completions path\n   - **Empty bars from Alpaca API**: No `start` parameter provided\n     - Added default start date (1 year for daily, 7 days for intraday)\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - LLM 100% failure \u2192 Working: Fixed through iterative debugging with console.log, identified model classification issue, temperature/max_tokens API differences\n   - Dashboard \"Researching candidates...\" with no data \u2192 Fixed: Alpaca bars API needed start date parameter\n   - Tested all fixes via MCP tools (`symbol-research`, `prices-bars`, `technicals-get`)\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"continue\"\n   - \"We already fixed this by moving the thing to US\"\n   - \"urk?\"\n   - \"URL?\"\n   - \"It says reasearching candidates but it seems not much is happening\"\n   - \"deployed?\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - None explicitly pending - all issues have been fixed and deployed\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The final fix was adding a default start date to the Alpaca `getBars()` function. This was causing the dashboard to show \"Researching candidates...\" because no price bars were being returned (Alpaca requires a start date). After deploying, both `prices-bars` and `technicals-get` work correctly.\n\n   Latest commit: `ee6ee01` - fix: add default start date for Alpaca bars API\n   Latest deploy: version `49d5fe03-28d6-4da6-b987-4c2ff8980171`\n\n   User asked \"deployed?\" and I confirmed yes.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   All requested fixes are complete and deployed. The dashboard should now populate with research data on the next cron cycle. No immediate next step required unless user reports further issues.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/projects/-Users-jurrejan-Documents-development-web-MAHORAGA/cbd96987-1eb1-4443-9ca3-36ac98a111da.jsonl",

This caused:\n   - Response status \"incomplete\" \n   - Only reasoning output items, no message items\n   \n6. **Fix 1 - Reasoning model classification**:\n   - Changed `REASONING_PREFIXES` from `['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5']` to `['o1', 'o3', 'o4']`\n   - Added `REASONING_EXACT = ['gpt-5']` for exact match only\n   - Updated `isReasoningModel()` to check both\n\n7. **Error: temperature not supported** - After deploying, got error that temperature is not supported with gpt-5-mini on Responses API.\n   - Added `NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5']`\n   - Added `supportsTemperature()` function\n   - Updated both Responses API and Chat Completions paths\n\n8. **User: \"We already fixed this by moving the thing to US\"** - They had already added location hint for the Durable Object.\n\n9. **Error: Geo-restriction persisted initially**, then after testing:\n   - Error changed to `max_tokens` not supported - need `max_completion_tokens`\n   - Fixed by using `max_completion_tokens` for gpt-5 family\n\n10. **More errors**:\n    - Routed `-mini` models to Chat Completions API (broader geo support)\n    - Fixed temperature for Chat Completions (gpt-5 family doesn't support custom temp)\n\n11. **LLM finally working** - `symbol-research AAPL` returned a full research report\n\n12. **User: \"urk?\"** - I tested TSLA, also worked\n\n13. **User: \"URL?\"** - Provided https://mahoraga.jurrejan.workers.dev\n\n14. **User: \"It says reasearching candidates but it seems not much is happening\"** - Dashboard shows \"Researching candidates...\" but no data\n\n15. **Investigation**:\n    - `signalResearch` was empty (that's why dashboard shows the message)\n    - `prices-bars` returned 0 bars\n    - `technicals-get` failed with \"Insufficient data\"\n    - Root cause: Alpaca bars API requires a `start` date, but none was provided\n\n16. **Fix - Default start date for bars**:\n    - Added default start date to `getBars()` in `market-data.ts`\n    - 1 year ago for daily, 7 days for intraday\n    - Deployed and tested - bars now return data\n\n17. **User: \"deployed?\"** - Confirmed yes, version `49d5fe03`\n\nKey files modified:\n- `src/providers/llm/openai.ts` - Multiple fixes for model classification, temperature, max_tokens\n- `src/providers/llm/anthropic.ts` - Empty content validation\n- `src/providers/alpaca/market-data.ts` - Default start date for bars\n\nCommits:\n- `e13993f` - fix: correct OpenAI Responses API parsing and model classification\n- `19cec67` - fix: remove temperature for gpt-5 family on Chat Completions\n- `ee6ee01` - fix: add default start date for Alpaca bars API\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Fix LLM issues causing 100% failure rate on all OpenAI API calls\n   - Diagnose why dashboard shows \"Researching candidates...\" with no data appearing\n   - Deploy fixes and verify they work in production\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - OpenAI Responses API vs Chat Completions API (different endpoints, response formats, parameter support)\n   - OpenAI model classification: reasoning models (o1, o3, o4, gpt-5) vs non-reasoning (gpt-5-mini, gpt-4o)\n   - Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects with location hints (`locationHint: 'wnam'`)\n   - Alpaca Market Data API - requires `start` date parameter for historical bars\n   - gpt-5 family API quirks: no custom temperature (only default 1), uses `max_completion_tokens` not `max_tokens`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`src/providers/llm/openai.ts`** (Critical - all LLM fixes)\n     - Fixed model classification, temperature handling, response parsing\n     ```typescript\n     // Reasoning models get special treatment (no temperature, reasoning effort param)\n     // Note: -mini variants are NOT reasoning models even if they use the Responses API\n     const REASONING_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4'];\n     // gpt-5 reasoning: only the full model, not mini\n     const REASONING_EXACT = ['gpt-5'];\n\n     // Models that use the Responses API (instead of Chat Completions)\n     const RESPONSES_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5', 'gpt-4.1', 'gpt-4o'];\n\n     // Models that don't support temperature on the Responses API\n     const NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES = ['o1', 'o3', 'o4', 'gpt-5'];\n\n     function matchesPrefix(model: string, prefixes: string[]): boolean {\n       return prefixes.some(p => model === p || model.startsWith(`${p}-`) || model.startsWith(`${p}.`));\n     }\n\n     function isReasoningModel(model: string): boolean {\n       // o1, o3, o4 prefixes are always reasoning\n       if (matchesPrefix(model, REASONING_PREFIXES)) return true;\n       // gpt-5 exact match only (not gpt-5-mini, gpt-5.1, etc.)\n       return REASONING_EXACT.includes(model);\n     }\n\n     function shouldUseResponses(model: string): boolean {\n       // Exclude -mini variants from Responses API (use Chat Completions for broader geo support)\n       if (model.endsWith('-mini')) return false;\n       return matchesPrefix(model, RESPONSES_PREFIXES);\n     }\n\n     function supportsTemperature(model: string): boolean {\n       return !matchesPrefix(model, NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES);\n     }\n     ```\n     - Response status validation:\n     ```typescript\n     function extractResponsesText(data: OpenAIResponsesResponse): string {\n       // Check response status - only \"completed\" has valid output\n       if (data.status && data.status !== 'completed') {\n         const errMsg = data.error?.message || `response status: ${data.status}`;\n         throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, `OpenAI Responses API: ${errMsg}`);\n       }\n\n       if (data.output_text) return data.output_text;\n\n       for (const item of data.output ?? []) {\n         if (item.type === 'message' && Array.isArray(item.content)) {\n           for (const block of item.content) {\n             if (block.type === 'text' && block.text) return block.text;\n           }\n         }\n       }\n\n       throw createError(ErrorCode.PROVIDER_ERROR, 'OpenAI Responses API returned empty content');\n     }\n     ```\n     - Chat Completions max_completion_tokens fix:\n     ```typescript\n     // gpt-5 family uses max_completion_tokens, older models use max_tokens\n     const usesMaxCompletionTokens = reasoning || model.startsWith('gpt-5');\n     if (usesMaxCompletionTokens) {\n       body.max_completion_tokens = params.max_tokens ?? 1024;\n     } else {\n       body.max_tokens = params.max_tokens ?? 1024;\n     }\n\n     // gpt-5 family doesn't support custom temperature (only default 1)\n     if (!reasoning && supportsTemperature(model)) {\n       body.temperature = params.temperature ?? 0.7;\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/providers/alpaca/market-data.ts`** (Fixed empty bars issue)\n     - Added default start date for bars API:\n     ```typescript\n     async getBars(symbol: string, timeframe: string, params?: BarsParams): Promise<Bar[]> {\n       // Default start: 1 year ago for daily, 7 days for intraday\n       const defaultStart = new Date();\n       if (timeframe === '1Day') {\n         defaultStart.setFullYear(defaultStart.getFullYear() - 1);\n       } else {\n         defaultStart.setDate(defaultStart.getDate() - 7);\n       }\n\n       const response = await this.client.dataRequest<AlpacaBarsResponse | { bars: AlpacaBar[] }>(\n         'GET',\n         `/v2/stocks/${encodeURIComponent(symbol)}/bars`,\n         {\n           timeframe,\n           start: params?.start ?? defaultStart.toISOString(),\n           end: params?.end,\n           limit: params?.limit,\n           adjustment: params?.adjustment,\n           feed: params?.feed,\n         }\n       );\n       // ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/providers/llm/anthropic.ts`** (Minor fix)\n     - Added empty text block validation\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **`status: \"incomplete\"` with only reasoning output**: gpt-5-mini was misclassified as reasoning model\n     - Fixed by separating `REASONING_PREFIXES` and `REASONING_EXACT`, excluding mini variants\n   - **`temperature not supported with this model`**: Responses API for gpt-5 family doesn't support temperature\n     - Added `NO_TEMPERATURE_PREFIXES` and `supportsTemperature()` function\n   - **`403 unsupported_country_region_territory`**: Geo-restriction on OpenAI API\n     - User had already fixed with `locationHint: 'wnam'` in DO stub\n     - Also routed `-mini` models to Chat Completions for broader geo support\n   - **`max_tokens not supported, use max_completion_tokens`**: gpt-5 family API difference\n     - Added check for gpt-5 prefix to use `max_completion_tokens`\n   - **`temperature 0.5 not supported, only default (1)`**: gpt-5-mini on Chat Completions\n     - Extended temperature exclusion to Chat Completions path\n   - **Empty bars from Alpaca API**: No `start` parameter provided\n     - Added default start date (1 year for daily, 7 days for intraday)\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - LLM 100% failure \u2192 Working: Fixed through iterative debugging with console.log, identified model classification issue, temperature/max_tokens API differences\n   - Dashboard \"Researching candidates...\" with no data \u2192 Fixed: Alpaca bars API needed start date parameter\n   - Tested all fixes via MCP tools (`symbol-research`, `prices-bars`, `technicals-get`)\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"continue\"\n   - \"We already fixed this by moving the thing to US\"\n   - \"urk?\"\n   - \"URL?\"\n   - \"It says reasearching candidates but it seems not much is happening\"\n   - \"deployed?\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - None explicitly pending - all issues have been fixed and deployed\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The final fix was adding a default start date to the Alpaca `getBars()` function. This was causing the dashboard to show \"Researching candidates...\" because no price bars were being returned (Alpaca requires a start date). After deploying, both `prices-bars` and `technicals-get` work correctly.\n\n   Latest commit: `ee6ee01` - fix: add default start date for Alpaca bars API\n   Latest deploy: version `49d5fe03-28d6-4da6-b987-4c2ff8980171`\n\n   User asked \"deployed?\" and I confirmed yes.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   All requested fixes are complete and deployed. The dashboard should now populate with research data on the next cron cycle. No immediate next step required unless user reports further issues.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/projects/-Users-jurrejan-Documents-development-web-MAHORAGA/cbd96987-1eb1-4443-9ca3-36ac98a111da.jsonl",
